Mono works fine with most of the dependencies, even when compiled as 4.0, except for FluorineFXMods.
It needs to be compiled with the 2.0 project, otherwise it just hangs on connecting, it seems.

Certificates need to be imported manually like this:

yes | certmgr -ssl "https://lq.na1.lol.riotgames.com/login-queue/rest/queue" --machine
yes | certmgr -ssl "rtmps://prod.na1.lol.riotgames.com:2099/" --machine
yes | certmgr -ssl "https://lq.eu.lol.riotgames.com/login-queue/rest/queue" --machine
yes | certmgr -ssl "rtmps://prod.eu.lol.riotgames.com:2099/" --machine
yes | certmgr -ssl "https://lq.eun1.lol.riotgames.com/login-queue/rest/queue" --machine
yes | certmgr -ssl "rtmps://prod.eun1.lol.riotgames.com:2099/" --machine

Otherwise errors such as this one can occur:

Authentication error: Error getting response stream (Write: The authentication or decryption has failed.): SendFailure
